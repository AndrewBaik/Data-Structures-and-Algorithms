# Quick Sort

## Summary
- Create a method that takes an unsorted array, and sort the array using quick sort.

## Solution
- I implemented a method that iterate through an array and relocate integers using while iterations based on an assigned pivot index value. 
Recursion initiates by calling the same methods with parameter of array, low index, and pivot, and array, pivot, and high index.
