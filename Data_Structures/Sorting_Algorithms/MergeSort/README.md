# Merge Sort

## Summary 
- Write a method that accepts an unsorted array of integers, and return a sorted array by a recursive merged sorted algorithm.

## Solution
- I've implemented two different methods, where one takes an array and divide it by half of its index length until only a single integers are
remaining on the left and right. Second methods takes those divided integers and sorts it by its size. All these occurs recursively and returns the
sorted array using merged sort.
