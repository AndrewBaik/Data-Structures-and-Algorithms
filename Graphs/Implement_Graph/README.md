# Implement Graph

## Directions
- Implement a graph as an Adjacency list that implement the following<br/>
	1. AddEdge()<br/>
		- Adds a new vertex to the graph<br/>
	2. GetNodes()<br/>
		- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection<br/>
	3. GetNeighbors()<br/>
		- Returns a collection of nodes that are connected to the given node<br/>
	4. Size()<br/>
		- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph<br/>
	5. BreadthFirst()<br/>
		- Takes a root node, and returns a collection of all the nodes visited in order.<br/>
<br/>
- Should contain following classes: Program, Node, and Graph,<br/>
- Test the functionalities of graph: <br/>
	- Size() returns the correct number of nodes back<br/>
	- GetNeighbors() returns the correct nodes given a vertice<br/>
	- Successfully able to Add an edge.<br/>

## Real life utilization
- Graphs is utilized in various different industries for different purposes. It can be used for plane traffics and GPS mapping purposes, also Social Network Platforms for connecting the data.
